thoughts on how to handle the checking game loop

    first, you need to check every row 
    then you need to check every column
    then you need to check every diagonal
    but if in checking you find any case where 
    the line has 3 of a kind, you stop

    approaches:
    1. put every row, every column, and every diagonal in an array then loop through the array and check until you find
    an array with 3 of a kind.
